        <center><h4>By Michael Friesen and Shayla Tran</h4></center>
        <p>The project, Who Let the Dogs Meet Up, resolves a problem to
            bring together all local information to the users regarding
            breeders, dog parks, and dog walkers that want to own a dog,
            attend activities to bond with their dogs, or would like a 
            person to care for their dog while they are away at work. 
            This website allows for a record of dogs to be stored and 
            associated with owners that allows them to see the potential 
            dog walkers, dog meetups, or dog breeders that are available 
            in their area. This database was deemed necessary to store 
            the many different kinds and breeds of dogs that one or 
            more owners may have, and to store all sorts of information 
            necessary for an active community of dog owners.
